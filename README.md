<h1>📝 Description</h1>
<h3>This plugin is one of my old works. This plugin allows you to prevent the player from falling into the abyss to a certain height set by the developer. In case the player's height level, specified by the developer, is lower than it should be, the player is returned to the place of spawn.</h3>

<h1>🔨 Framework</h1>
<p>
    <h3>IntelliJ IDEA Community development environment was used to develop the project</h3>

<h1>📜 Requirements</h1>
<h3><a href="https://mavenlibs.com/maven/dependency/org.projectlombok/lombok">Lombok (org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.32)</a> library makes it easier to develop Java code, especially with regard to generating getters, setters, constructors, equals(), hashCode(), toString() methods and other common code patterns. It provides annotations that automatically generate code at compile time, which frees developers from the routine of manually generating such code. In this case, compileOnly and annotationProcessor indicate that Lombok is used only during compilation, and is not included in the final assembly artifact.</h3>
<h3><a href="https://mavenlibs.com/maven/dependency/com.github.azbh111/spigot-1.8.8">Spigot (org.spigotmc:spigot-api:1.8.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT)</a> is a modification of the Minecraft server that provides various additional functions and APIs for plugin development. This spigot api library contains a set of classes and methods that allow you to interact with the game world, players and other elements of the Minecraft server to develop plugins, modifications and other custom functions. Here, the implementation indicates that the Spigot API is used not only during compilation, but is also included in the final assembly artifact.</h3>
